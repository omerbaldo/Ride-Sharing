Application that makes it easier for students at Rutgers to get to classes between campuses, and to help reduce pollution. The general idea is for users to register with the system and then (on different occasions) take on one of two roles: 1) driver, offering a ride; 2) potential passenger, needing a ride. This can be on a one-of basis or as a regular car-pool arrangement. The general purpose of the system is to match up, as best as possible the ride offers/requests, to create an actual completed ride, and help with communication. 

Implemented using JSP and Amazon Web Services MySQL Server.
